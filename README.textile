h2. Installation

Download the clj jar file (or follow the instructions below to build from source):

@wget http://incanter.org/downloads/clj-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT-standalone.jar@

and either double-click on the jar file to run self-install, or run the self-install command from the command line:

@java -jar clj-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT-standalone.jar self-install@


*self-install will:*
* create a @$HOME/.clj@ directory 
* initialize a local reposistory for Clojure packages in @$HOME/.clj/lib@
* create the shell and Windows batch scripts, 
** @$HOME/.clj/bin/clj@
** @$HOME/.clj/bin/clj.bat@


You should either add @$HOME/.clj/bin@ to your path,

@export PATH=~/.clj/bin:$PATH@

or move the clj scripts to a directory on your path.
